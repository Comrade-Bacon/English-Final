  All social media platforms, news, and podcasts are owned by international elites,
  hindering freedom of speech. The education system is centralized, corrupt, and full
  of modern communists. People are taught radical left-wing ideologies as facts in
  all levels of school. The United States is essentially a surveillance state above
  the level of modern-day China and has limited the second amendment to bolt-action
  rifles and revolvers.  Gass vehicles, stoves, and power generators are banned.
  Thus, causing widespread famine especially when paired with the too quickly converted
  green electrical grid which fails regularly for extended periods of time. The United
  States has drifted so far from its founding that it has become what it fought against
  and has lost what made it great and unique. Only a few patriots still hold out.

  sitting in my apartment in Dallas, ruminating about how to garner more support
  for the freedom fighters when I look down at my phone. A message from a close,
  trusted friend says, “Foxtrot Eco Delta; Oscar Mike; Your; Alfa Oscar; 2 Mikes”
  A simple code, but one that the average person accidentally stumbling across my
  phone shouldn't think twice about. I quickly go to the other room and grab my bug
  out bag, plate carrier, and AR-15. Before I head out, I look out the window. I saw
  four vans speeding towards the apartment complex. It was too late to run. I activated
  an app on my phone that sends an emergency message to my squad, within two minutes
  me and six other guys in full kit rallied and initiated our plan to quickly fortify
  our floor. Just as we moved and flipped the first table into place, we suddenly
  heard footsteps. I post up on a door frame and aim my rifle directly at the
  entrance to the staircase. After a moment, I see a man in a navy-blue swat
  uniform come onto our floor. The only thing is, he's not from the Dallas Police
  Department, his plate carrier says A.T.F. in big yellow letters. PAHCK! PAHCK! He
  goes down. Then the second, and the third. By this time others in my squad had taken
  note and begun to cover the doorway in an eruption of gunfire. I then ducked behind the
  wall and moved to a new vantage point. Just then, they threw a nine-bang flashbang
  ito the hallway, and briefly stunned a couple of my guys, but we were able to keep
  the feds from entering our area for a little longer. It was evident that we were
  running out of time. After firing a few more shots I peeked out the window in the
  room I had re-positioned to. One of the ends of the alley appeared to be clear. I
  communicated this to my team, and we were able to bail out the window, down the fire
  escape, and down the alley. At one end the front of one of the vans the feds had arrived
  in was visible, and the driver noticed us going in the other direction. One of my buddies
  let off a few shots to get his head down as we moved out of the alley. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
  200%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>We immediately
  ducked into a store on the other side and slipped on hoodies to cover our plate carriers
  and make it harder for the agents that saw us to recognize us. I took the upper receiver
  off the lower of my rifle and stuck the two into my backpack. We then went our separate
  ways to eventually meet up at a ranch just outside of the city. We had to slip past
  several checkpoints on the way, sometimes almost getting caught, but whether it was
  luck, or divine intervention, we all made it to begin planning coordinating for
  another operation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

  kind of excerpt from my imagination has been in line with the general theme of
  my imagination for several years now. It has evolved from fighting against prison
  breakers in space in first grade, to fighting off a Red Dawn style Soviet invasion
  in fourth grade to most recently a corrupt government that has completely disregarded
  not only the founders' intents, but also the constitution. The above transcribed
  thought ramble shows a few things about me. The first being I Do not trust the
  government. Another being I have a verry bleak outlook for the United States if
  we continue down the route we are currently on. And the final is I likely play a
  little too much Call of Duty and watch a few too many 80's action movies. *Insert
  Die Hard quote here*<o:p></o:p></span></p>
