  0pt'>I consider the beginning of fifth grade to be the last time my overall quality
  of life was consistently getting better. We had just moved into a new house, I
  went to Arizona for National Navajo Code talker Day, school wasn't going too bad, we went on awesome vacations, and
  2019 was just a great year in general. But not long after the school year
  began, my parents told me my dad had pancreatic cancer. Things had gone downhill
  before that because my parents had known but didn't let
  us know for two or three months. Regardless, this is what I consider to be the
  official turning point for the next two to three years. From there life
  gradually went downhill, but most things were functioning as normally as
  possible with a sick family member. There were ups and
  downs, but for the most part it was as stable as could be. In late
  2019 to early 2020 we learned that the cancer had spread, making things exponentially
  worse. January of 2020 was also when Covid 19 first came about.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

  0pt'>I remember when kids started bringing gators and handkerchiefs to school
  to wear in "protection" from the virus. They got in so much trouble, the
  irony of that is hysterical. At the same time, I remember radio hosts urging
  people not to cause an N95 shortage. It was probably less
  than a month later when whatever the big regulatory governing body was
  started urging people to wear a mask. And then, in February, while on spring
  break we were told we could not go back to school
  for the fourteen days to "slow the spread." Eventually fourteen became indefinite,
  and we never actually ended up going back to school. It was during this time that I think I left my house a total of four or five times.
  On average, my grades became terrible. I don't think
  I passed more than a single class during the online "learning." Also, during
  this period, one night at dinner I said something along the
  lines of, <o:p></o:p></span></p>

  replied in a soft tone with something like,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

  0pt'>"Listen to me. This virus thing is nothing you [and your siblings]
  worry about. If it
  or if it is your mother and I would tell you." Never was I told that it was
  something to worry about. The end of this period was when the cancer really
  got bad. Hospice had to come into our home, and at the end, we had a kind of
  hospital bed thing in our master bedroom. When I look at pictures I took on a
  knock off GoPro I got that Christmas there are pictures of things like the
  oxygen tanks sitting next to the stairwell. A few
  weeks after school ended, my father died, depending on how you look at it,
  over a week to a month after the doctors had predicted. When my uncle came
  out of the room, to tell me the bad news, he was obviously
  distraught. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

  was shocked, that whole week, and before I had convinced myself that he would
  pull through. Not of the people he was closest
  to came to see him because they thought they would kill him two months early
  with the world ending virus.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

  0pt'>Eventually going back to school was not easy either. Fortunately, I went
  to a charter school and got to go back full time. Nonetheless, it was still difficult.
  They told us we had to wear masks, then we didn't,
  then somebody who couldn't bear to have their child within a mile of a germ
  sewed the schools and we had to wear masks again. They told us we couldn't talk to our friends. They told us we could not
  use lockers because they're germ lockboxes. During
  all of this, my question is why did nobody stand up? Why were people too
  scared to say no, you can't tell me my business, my
  church, my livelihood, provides no service to society and therefore is a
  danger and needs to be shut down. You can't tell me I'll
  lose my job because I chose to make a different personal medical decision
  than the president. When nobody stands, it becomes that much easier for the
  few that do stand to be slaughtered. C&C
  Breakfast and Korean Kitchen was forced to
  close because they didn't want to become bankrupt because
  of the restrictions. When I refused to wear a mask in school my diabetic
  teacher essentially asked me why my breathing was
  more important than his life. I also had to sit with the dean and explain why
  I hated masks. And then we find out none of it made a difference.
  I have now learned, if the media says it is a conspiracy, it's
  likely not a conspiracy. And all of this, in the land of the afraid, and the
  home of the regulated. Never again will I nor many other
  members of the American public allow ourselves to be subjugated ever again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
